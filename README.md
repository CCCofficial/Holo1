# Holography
Images and Python code for holographic microscope. This repository is dedicated to our work on an inexpensive digital in-line holographic microscope made from a laser, image sensor and Raspberry Pi. Construction instructions can be found here in the youtube video, youtu.be/zqBVLydhUBg "Microscope Kit V3" (2020). This project is supported by the Center for Cellular Construction (ccc.ucsf.edu) and the National Science Foundation under Grant No. DBI-1548297.
